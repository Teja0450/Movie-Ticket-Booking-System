This project is a desktop-based movie ticket booking application developed using Python, Tkinter, ttkbootstrap, PIL, and QRCode. It simulates a real cinema booking workflow with a clean and modern interface.
The system includes multiple pages such as:
Movie & showtime selection
Seat selection with a 10×10 grid
Optional snack ordering
Payment selection
Final ticket generation

Users can book up to 6 seats, with real-time seat availability shown through color-coded buttons (available, selected, booked). Snacks can be chosen with automatic price calculation. Once payment is confirmed (simulated), the app generates a unique Booking ID and an e-ticket with all details.

A QR code is automatically created containing the ticket information, offering a professional and realistic booking experience. The interface uses the “superhero” theme from ttkbootstrap, making the UI visually appealing and user-friendly.

Overall, this project demonstrates skills in GUI development, modular design, event handling, and integration of external libraries for image and QR code generation.
